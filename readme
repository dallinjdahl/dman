dman

This script is a dmenu[1] interface to the library of currently installed
man pages using the execline[2] scripting language.  The current version also
has support for viewing plan9port[3] man pages by adding ; to the input.
By default this terminal is st[4].

pkg/install

This script is designed to create a symlink to the dman script in a
location easily appended to the PATH variable.  By default, it creates
the symlink at ../../bin, which assumes an organization similar to
the following, inspired by DJB's /package hierarchy[5]:

sys: root for sysadmin files (not necessarily in root)
sys/bin: symlinks to all binaries intended to be run by the end user.
sys/pkg: root for packages, including source code, config, and binaries.
sys/pkg/dman: dman package
